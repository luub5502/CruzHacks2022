# CruzHacks2022
Since we haven't yet gotten our website hosted, to view our website, simply run python3 cruzHacksFlask.py in the command line, and this will run the server. Go to the address it shows in a browser, and you will be able to see our site in action.

Right now, it simply takes a link and verifies that it is actually a link to a webpage, but we haven't given it much functionality other than that. Once we get a model working, we will connect this site with the webscraping and our model to predict whether a given site is fake news or not.
